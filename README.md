    JBA Account Page: This could be a dedicated section of the program/platform where students can access their JBA (presumably referring to Junior Business Analyst) account. Here, they might be able to view their academic records, manage their profile information, access resources related to their program, or perform other administrative tasks related to their studies.

    Chat for Communication: Providing a chat feature within the program/platform allows students to easily communicate with the responsible doctor or academic advisor. This could be used for asking questions, seeking guidance on coursework or academic matters, scheduling appointments, or receiving general support and advice.

    Page About College Rules: This page would contain information about the rules, policies, and regulations of the university or college. It might cover academic integrity guidelines, disciplinary procedures, code of conduct, campus regulations, and any other important rules that students need to be aware of during their time at the institution.

Integrating these features into an academic program/platform can help streamline communication, provide easy access to important resources and information, and ultimately enhance the overall experience for students at the university.
